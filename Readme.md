# Headspace

**Welcome to your Headspace!**

**Headspace is a program that allows users to access, build, and organize their file system in virtual reality. Created by: [Jayme Ramsay](https://github.com/jaymeramsay), [John McCambridge](https://github.com/nol166), and [Peter Sarkis](https://github.com/Turbulence9) in the course of a week**

*Our Goal* was to create an a more interactive, kinesthetic file system for users while learning VR technologies

Technologies:
* Unity IDE
* C#
* Steam VR Plug-in

### Challenges:

* This is our first program using the language C#, and we learned so much about the object-oriented nature of it and how it works with Unity to create a virtual environment.

* Much of our time was spent researching the Unity game engine and trying to find the most efficient ways to execute our technical challenges. It was difficult to accomplish all of our goals in the allotted time. In the process, we learned more valuable research techniques.

* Only one of our computers was able to use the VR-plugin, which meant that only one of us could write code for the Headspace program at a time. We had to organize ourselves so that while one person focused on and altered the program the other two did research and made test code in Unity on the other computers. We'd send our sample code through messenger and alter it to work with the VR-plugin.

* Trying to get a standard draw feature to work in VR was super challenging because we're working in a 3D environment instead of 2D. In Unity, there are many constraints with which components you can use on game objects. For every idea we tried, some constraint popped up, and we'd have to pivot our idea.
